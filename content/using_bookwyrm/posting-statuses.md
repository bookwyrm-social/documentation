Posting on BookWyrm starts with a book.
Users can comment on in-progress or recently read books from the "Your books" section, or from a book's landing page.
From there, users can reply and start a conversation.
BookWyrm posts can include formatting like bold, italics and links using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

If you're familiar with [posting on Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/), you'll find that BookWyrm statuses have analogous visibility settings, content warnings, and mentions. However, polls, custom emoji, and attachments are not supported yet.

## Types of statuses

### User commentary

There are three types of posts users can create directly in response to books: reviews, comments, and quotes. Comments respond to general aspects of a book, quotes pertain to specific passages, and reviews deal with books overall. Users can also reply to statuses.

| Component | Review | Comment | Quote | Reply |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| Text field | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Spoiler alert | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Page number | | ✔ | ✔  |
| Quote | |  | ✔  |
| Rating | ✔ |  |  |
| Title field | ✔ |  |  |

#### Spoiler alerts

Spoiler alerts (also known as content warnings) are useful to give people a warning before they read a status that might spoil the plot of a book they want to read.
Usually just putting "contains spoilers" or something similar is sufficient, but you can be more specific, especially if your status discusses potentially sensitive topics.

#### Star ratings

A star rating can be added to reviews, or added on its own by clicking the stars below a book.
It is a 5-star scale, and half stars can be added by double clicking on the star.
For example, if you want to rate 2.5 stars, you'd click on 3 stars then click again on the third star to make it half.
When viewing a book or reviews, the star ratings are hidden until the user selects "Show rating".

### Reading status updates

Statuses are generated when a user indicates that they want to read, have started reading, or have finished reading a book.
