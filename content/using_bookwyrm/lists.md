Lists in Bookwyrm are a way to organise and display similar books together.

The Lists page is accessible from the 'Lists' tab on the main page.
To see your Lists, click 'Your Lists' below the title or navigate to your profile to the Lists tab.

## Creating a List

To create a List, first select the 'Create List' button on the top right of the page.
It needs a name, and you can optionally add a description. 
You will then choose how you'd like to curate the List.

## List curation

There are four options for List curation:

- **Closed**: Only you can add and remove books to this list.
- **Curated**: Anyone can suggest books, subject to your approval.
- **Open**: Anyone can add books to this list. Only you can remove them.
- **Group**: [Group](/groups.html) members can add to and remove from this list .

## List privacy

Lists have similar privacy levels as other things in Bookwyrm: Public, Unlisted, Followers and Private. 
See more details on the [privacy controls](/privacy-controls.html#lists) page.

## Adding books to a List

You can add books to any List that you own, "Open" Lists and group-curated Lists of Groups you are a part of.
You can also suggest books to "Curated" Lists in the exact same way.

There is a side menu (at the bottom on mobile) titled "Add books" or "Suggest books".
It shows books that you've recently interacted with on Bookwyrm, and a search bar.
Currently, the search is limited to book titles (see issue [#3607](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues/3607)).
Once you find the one you want, use the 'Add' button to add it to the List.

### Notes

You can add a "Note" to each book in a List, which could be used to explain why it was added.
Notes are added when a book is first added, or at any time with the 'Add notes' button.
They are displayed with the book when the List is viewed.
To delete a note, edit it, remove everything in it, then press 'Save'.

### List order

The owner or curator of the List can set a custom display order for the books in it.
By default, new books are added to the end of the List.
The position of a book can be changed with the 'List position' box below each book.

## Sorting Lists

You can sort by the manually created list order, book title or average rating, in ascending and descending order.

## Lists sidetab on book pages

There is a sidetab on each books page which shows the Lists it is in, if it is in any.
This is great for finding similar books suggested by the community.

## Saving Lists

Lists can be 'saved' or bookmarked using the button in the top right when viewing it.
There is a tab on the main Lists page which shows all your saved Lists, allowing you to find it later.

## Embedding Lists on other websites

If you have a blog or personal website, you are able to embed a List from Bookwyrm onto it.
Find the section 'Embed this list on a website' below sorting and adding books, then copy the embed code.
This is in the form of an iframe and can be pasted directly into your website.
