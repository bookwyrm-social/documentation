An integral part of managing your reading is organising your books and their read status.
On Bookwyrm, you use Shelves for this.

To get to the shelves page, select the 'Your Books' link at the top of the website.
The tabs are your shelves, as well as an 'All books' view.

## Reading Status Shelves

Bookwyrm comes with four default shelves: To Read, Currently Reading, Read and Stopped Reading.
These are used to track the reading status of each of your books.

### Updating reading status

When browsing books on Bookwyrm, there is a button below or beside each book, used to update its reading status.

BookWyrm expects the flow of `Not shelved` -> `To read` -> `Currently reading` -> `Read`.
So the default option will always advance the book along this flow.
Other options are available from the dropdown arrow.

### Only on one status shelf

A book can only be on one of the four reading status shelves at a time.
When you update your reading progress, the book is moved from one shelf to the next.
This means that if you're reading a book for a second time, it will be put on Currently Reading and not on Read, even though you had read it before.

### Reading activity dates

When starting and finishing a book, you are prompted to confirm the start and finish dates.
These can be seen on a books page under the 'Your reading activity' subtitle.
If you manually add read dates, keep in mind that it won't automatically shelve the book.

### Posting status updates

In the same pop-up screen you confirm reading dates, you have the option to post a reading status update to your feed.
These will appear in the feeds of people who follow you, and have similar [visibility settings](/privacy-controls.html) as most things in Bookwyrm.

### Finish reading or stop reading?

Use 'Finish reading' when you've finished reading a book.

'Stop reading' is for books you don't want to keep reading, also known as a DNF (did not finish).

## Custom Shelves

Custom shelves are completely separate from the reading status shelves.
Adding books to them works the same though.

### On multiple custom shelves

As opposed to the built-in reading status shelves, a book can be on multiple custom shelves at once.
It could also be on a reading status shelf at the same time as one or more custom shelves, or just on a custom shelf.

## Editing shelf descriptions

You can add a description to any shelf by selecting the shelf and then 'Edit shelf'.

## Filtering your books

Currently, the only available filter is by keyword, which searches against the title and author.

## Shelf Privacy

By default, your shelves are all Public. 
To restrict a shelf to Followers-only or Private, navigate to it and select 'Edit shelf'.
For more information, see the [privacy controls](/privacy-controls.html) page. 

## All Books View

The default tab on the 'Your books' page is 'All books'.
It simply displays any book that is on at least one of your shelves.
Books on Follower-only shelves will only be displayed there to you and your followers, and books on Private shelves only to you.
