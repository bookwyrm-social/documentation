BookWyrm is a social network for tracking your reading, talking about books, writing reviews, and discovering what to read next. Federering tillåter BookWyrm-användare att gå med i små, pålitliga gemenskaper som kan ansluta med varandra, och med andra ActivityPub-tjänster så som Mastodon och Pleroma.

## Funktioner
