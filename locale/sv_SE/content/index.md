BookWyrm is a social network for tracking your reading, talking about books, writing reviews, and discovering what to read next. Federering tillåter BookWyrm-användare att gå med i små, pålitliga gemenskaper som kan ansluta med varandra, och med andra ActivityPub-tjänster så som Mastodon och Pleroma.

## Funktioner
Since the project is still in its early stages, the features are growing every day, and there is plenty of room for suggestions and ideas. Öppna en [felrapport](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues) för att få igång konversationen!s
