„BookWyrm“ – tai socialinis tinklas, skirtas sekti savo skaitymą, kalbėti apie knygas, rašyti apžvalgas ir sužinoti, ką skaityti toliau. Federacija leidžia „BookWyrm“ naudotojams jungtis prie nedidelių, patikimų bendruomenių, kurios gali susijungti tarpusavyje ir su kitomis „ActivityPub“ paslaugomis, tokiomis kaip „Mastodon“ ir „Pleroma“.
