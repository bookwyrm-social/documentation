There are a few different ways to add books to your BookWyrm instance! When you can't find the book you're looking for, try these options in order -- it's better to import a book than to create one from scratch.

## Importing data about your books and reading

If you're coming to BookWyrm from another platform for tracking books and reading, you may want to import your books and reading data. Currently BookWyrm is capable of importing export files from the following platforms:

* Calibre (CSV)
* Goodreads (CSV)
* LibraryThing (TSV)
* OpenLibrary (CSV)
* Storygraph (CSV)
* OpenReads (CSV)

Under 'Settings' navigate to 'Import Book List', select the matching data source, select your file and, if relevant, select whether to import reviews and what privacy setting to give them. When you press 'Import' a background task will begin to import your data. You will be notified when it has finished.

It is important to understand that the import process does not import data directly from the other service - in many cases (e.g. Goodreads) this is not possible. When you import a data file, BookWyrm will search the local database, connected BookWyrm servers, and selected public data sources to find a match. For this reason, BookWyrm may not be able to import all of your data. We are always looking for new data sources with free and open APIs, especially for data about books in languages other than English. If you are aware of such a data source, please consider [creating an Issue](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues),

## Loading books from other catalogs

If the book you're looking for isn't available on your BookWyrm instance, there are a few different ways to add it. The best way is to import it from an outside source -- your instance can load books from other BookWyrm instances, as well as [OpenLibrary](http://openlibrary.org/) and [Inventaire](http://inventaire.io/). If there are no search results for your query, these sources will automatically be queried, and will show up with a button to "**Import book**". If there are local search results that aren't what you're looking for, you can click the "**Load results from other catalogues**" link to load more results.


## Adding another edition

Jei radote norimą knygą, tačiau nerandate norimo šios knygos leidimo, galite iš leidimų sąrašo prie darbo pridėti kitą leidimą. Click the link below the description that tells you how many editions there are (for example, "**4 editions**"). At the bottom of the editions list, there is a button to "**Add another edition**".

## Add a completely new book

Once you've tried searching for your book, importing it from another catalog, and finding other editions of the book, you can add a new book manually. Nuoroda manualiai pridėti knygą yra paieškos puslapio apačioje, kai rodomi išoriniai katalogai. You can also navigate directly to `/create-book` on your instance.
