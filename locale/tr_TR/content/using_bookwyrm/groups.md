You can join or create a Group with others on Bookwyrm.
There are many things a group could be made for - a book club, a bunch of friends, whatever makes sense for you.
Groups can curate book [Lists](lists.html) together, but that's about it right now.
Currently, the Bookwyrm developers are focusing on other things, not groups, but they will be improved in the future.

To find the groups page, first navigate to your profile, then open the 'Groups' tab.

## Group administration

### Creating a group

On the top right of the groups page is the 'Create group' button.
You will then need to give it a name and describe what it is about, before choosing its privacy setting.

### Group privacy

Groups have the same privacy settings as posts and lists do, except they can't be Followers-only.
Group membership always requires an invitation from the group's owner, even if it is marked Public.
For more details, see [here](/privacy-controls#Groups).

### Adding and removing users

Groups are currently limited only to members on the current instance.
To add members, search their username in the search bar, then click 'Invite'.
To remove members, click the 'Remove' button and then 'Confirm'.

## Group membership

### Joining a group

To join a group, you must be on the same instance (website) and be invited by its owner.
You will then receive a notification which lets you join.
The group owner is marked with a star symbol.

### Using group Lists

Group Lists work very similarly to normal Lists, except they are curated by all members of a Group.
They can be created by any member of a group from the group's homepage.
