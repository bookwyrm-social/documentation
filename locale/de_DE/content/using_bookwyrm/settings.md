## Account Security

We recommend you protect your account with second-factor authentication using an authenticator app.

This section also allows you to see all the logged-in sessions for your user account, and terminate them. This can be a useful way to protect your account if you have, for example, lost a device, or do not recognise a session.

## Aliases and moving your account

You can set an "alias" for your account, indicating that they represent the same "actor". This is usually done when you want to migrate your account from one fediverse account to another.

You can also move (migrate) your account using `Move Account`. You must set the account you are moving _from_ as an alias of the account you are moving _to_ before attempting to move the account.

Setting an alias is easily reversable. Moving your account is not - choose wisely!

See [User Migration and Aliases](user-migration.html) for more details.

## Deactivating or deleting your account

Under `Delete Account` you can either deactivate or delete your account.

Deactivating marks your account as no longer active and hides your profile page. You can re-activate your account in future.

Deleting your account is irreversable. Your username will not be available to register in the future. Note that on deleting your account, BookWyrm will attempt to delete all user data and posts, however it is possible that federated servers may not process the deletion correctly.

Books that were added by a deleted user will remain available as they conceptually exist separately from any individual user or shelf.

## Importing and Exporting books

Under the `Data` heading, you can import and export book lists.

See [Adding Books](/adding-books.html) for more information about importing books. Choose `Export Book List` to export a CSV file including all the books on your shelves, books you have reviewed, and books with reading activity.

You can also import or export a user account from this section. See [User Migration and Aliases](user-migration.html) for more details.

## Blocking users

You can block or unblock a user by selecting the ellipses (...) on the right of the "Follow/Unfollow" button on their profile.

If you have blocked any users, they will be listed under `Blocked Users` and can be unblocked from there.

Blocked users cannot see your profile, lists, or shelves, send you DMs, or see or interact with your posts.
