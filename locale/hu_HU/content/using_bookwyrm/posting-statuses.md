Posting on BookWyrm starts with a book. Users can comment on in-progress or recently read books from the "Your books" section, or from a book's landing page. From there, users can reply and start a conversation. BookWyrm posts can include formatting like bold, italics and links using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

If you're familiar with [posting on Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/), you'll find that BookWyrm statuses have analogous visibility settings, content warnings, and mentions. However, polls, custom emoji, and attachments are not supported yet.

## Types of statuses

### User commentary

There are three types of posts users can create directly in response to books: reviews, comments, and quotes. Comments respond to general aspects of a book, quotes pertain to specific passages, and reviews deal with books overall. Users can also reply to statuses.

| Component     | Review | Comment | Quote | Reply |
| ------------- | ------ | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| Text field    | ✔      | ✔       | ✔     | ✔     |
| Spoiler alert | ✔      | ✔       | ✔     | ✔     |
| Page number   |        | ✔       | ✔     |       |
| Quote         |        |         | ✔     |       |
| Rating        | ✔      |         |       |       |
| Title field   | ✔      |         |       |       |

#### Spoiler alerts

Spoiler alerts (also known as content warnings) are useful to give people a warning before they read a status that might spoil the plot of a book they want to read. Usually just putting "contains spoilers" or something similar is sufficient, but you can be more specific, especially if your status discusses potentially sensitive topics.

#### Star ratings

A star rating can be added to reviews, or added on its own by clicking the stars below a book. It is a 5-star scale, and half stars can be added by double clicking on the star. For example, if you want to rate 2.5 stars, you'd click on 3 stars then click again on the third star to make it half. When viewing a book or reviews, the star ratings are hidden until the user selects "Show rating".

### Reading status updates

Statuses are generated when a user indicates that they want to read, have started reading, or have finished reading a book.
