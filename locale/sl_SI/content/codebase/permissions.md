User access to different features is controlled using Django's [built-in authentication system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/default/). When an instance is created, the `initdb` script creates a set of permissions, which are assinged to groups. By default, all new users are assigned the `editor` group, which allows them to edit book metadata.

The instance administrator should have `superuser` status, which gives them access to Django admin (`/admin`) and confers all permissions to that user.

## Permissions and groups
This table shows the four groups (admin, moderator, editor, and user) and what permissions users in that group have:
