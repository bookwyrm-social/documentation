There are a few different ways to add books to your BookWyrm instance! When you can't find the book you're looking for, try these options in order -- it's better to import a book than to create one from scratch.

## Loading books from other catalogs

If the book you're looking for isn't available on your instance, there are a few different ways to add it. The best way is to import it from an outside source -- your instance can load books from other BookWyrm instances, as well as [OpenLibrary](http://openlibrary.org/) and [Inventaire](http://inventaire.io/). If there are no search results for your query, these sources will automatically be queried, and will show up with a button to "**Import book**". If there are local search results that aren't what you're looking for, you can click the "**Load results from other catalogues**" link to load more results.


## Adding another edition

Если вы нашли книгу, которую вы хотите, но не правильный вариант, вы можете добавить еще одну редакцию в работу из списка изданий. Click the link below the description that tells you how many editions there are (for example, "**4 editions**"). At the bottom of the editions list, there is a button to "**Add another edition**".

## Add a completely new book

Once you've tried searching for your book, importing it from another catalog, and finding other editions of the book, you can add a new book manually. The link to manually add a book is at the bottom of the search page when external catalogs are shown. You can also navigate direclty to `/create-book` on your instance.
