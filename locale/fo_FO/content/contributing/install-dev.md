## Prerequisites

These instructions assume you are developing BookWyrm using Docker. You'll need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to get started.

## Setting up the developer environment

- Get a copy of [the BookWyrm codebase from GitHub](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm). You can [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the repository, and then [use `git clone` to download the code](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) to your computer.
- Go to the directory which contains the code on your computer, you'll be working from there from here on out.
- Set up your development environment variables file by copying the example environment file (`.env.example`) into a new file named `.env`. In the command line, you can do this with:
``` { .sh }
cp .env.example .env
```
- In `.env`, change `DEBUG` to `true`
- Optionally, you can use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to set up a domain name, and set the `DOMAIN` variable in your `.env` file to the domain name generated by ngrok.

- Set up nginx for development by copying the developer nginx configuration file (`nginx/development`) into a new file named `nginx/default.conf`:
``` { .sh }
cp nginx/development nginx/default.conf
```

- Start the application. In the command line, run:
``` { .sh }
./bw-dev build            # Build the docker images
./bw-dev setup            # Initialize the database and run migrations
./bw-dev up               # Start the docker containers
```
- Once the build is complete, you can access the instance at `http://localhost:1333` and create an admin user.

If you're curious: the `./bw-dev` command is a simple shell script runs various other tools: above, you could skip it and run `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose up` directly if you like. `./bw-dev` just collects them into one common place for convenience. Run it without arguments to get a list of available commands, read the [documentation page](/command-line-tool.html) for it, or open it up and look around to see exactly what each command is doing!

### Editing or creating Models

If you change or create a model, you will probably change the database structure. For these changes to have effect you will need to run Django's `makemigrations` command to create a new [Django migrations file](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/migrations), and then `migrate` it:

``` { .sh }
./bw-dev makemigrations
./bw-dev migrate
```

### Editing static files
Any time you edit the CSS or JavaScript, you will need to run Django's `collectstatic` command again in order for your changes to have effect:
``` { .sh }
./bw-dev collectstatic
```

If you have [installed yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), you can run `yarn watch:static` to automatically run the previous script every time a change occurs in `bookwyrm/static` directory.
